# footpath-search

This is my submission for ***Project 1 of COMP20003 Algorithms and Data Structures in Sem 2 2022***. 

## Overview

This program utilizes a linked list to create a dictionary that stores information about footpaths in Melbourne sourced from a given dataset. The dictionary is constructed by reading the data from a file and inserting each footpath record as a node in the linked list. The program also incorporates a search function that allows users to retrieve information about footpaths in Melbourne using attributes (keys) in the dataset. When a match is found, the program outputs the relevant record(s) associated with the key.
